					<h1>Grading</h1>
					<h2>Design</h2>
					<p>
						All the pages looks like from the same website.
					</p>
					<p>
						Use of CRAP principles.
					</p>
					<p>
						Logo and formatting are the same on all pages. Same thing with the global navigation, which allows a visitor to jump to any top-level page.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is an indication of where the visitor is in the website. Visitor can also go to the “home” through any page.
					</p>
					<p>
						The site is easy to navigate.
					</p>
					<p>
						Page titles reflects the actual content of the page.
					</p>
					<p>
						A color scheme is used.
					</p>
					<p>
						Use of a Google Font: Titillium Web.
					</p>

					<h2>Structure</h2>
					<p>
						Head and footer codes are contained in an SSI
					</p>
					<p>
						Use of one external CSS file (Custom.css) containing all style.
					</p>
					<p>
						HTML and CSS codes are readable, indented, whitespaced, and commented.
					</p>
					<p>
						Pages validate.
					</p>
					<p>
						The site looks good on any browser and mobile devices.
					</p>

					<h2>Content</h2>
					<p>
						The site has two images of maps that shows the place being described in this site.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sufficiently describes the place with a good amount of quality textual content and was written to make the site visitors want to visit this place.
					</p>
					<p>
						Appropriate and attractive images are well placed within the text.
					</p>
					<p>
						Images have an appropriate URL link below for reference (if not created by me).
					</p>
					<p>
						There are more than 10 pages, including the grading page (this one).
					</p>
					<p>
						Good spelling and grammar.
					</p>

					<h1>Grading 2</h1>
					<h2>Javascript</h2>
						<p>
							A page called "money.php" was created. In this page, there is a money currency conversor.	
							Two javascript functions were created: moneyConversion1() and moneyConversion2(), the first converts from usd to brl and the second converts from brl to usd.
						</p>

						<p>
							Javascript was also used to validate the blog and to create a carousel image gallery on the homepage.
						</p>
					<h2>Dynamic Component</h2>
						<p>
							The dynamic component created was a carousel image gallery on the homepage. Every 3 seconds a new image is shown on the page.
						</p>
					<h2>Responsive</h2>
						<p>
							Media Queries were included on the css file to fix the elements on the website in 5 different resolutions.
						</p>
					<h2>PHP Blog</h2>
						<p>
							A page called "blog.php" was created for visitors to leave their names and comments on the site. To access this page, the visitor
							must go to the end of the homepage.
						</p>
					<h2>Extras</h2>
						<p>
							All pages are using PHP includes for navigation, submenus, header and other things that are repeated among them.
						</p>
						<p>
							All images were saved for web, so they can load quickly. A change from 16.4 MB (from the Project Part 1) to 2 MB (now on Project Part 2) 
							happened after the reduction of their sizes!
						</p>
						<p>
							Submenus were created for CULTURE and DAILY LIFE pages (nature.php / food.php / music.php / art.php / school.php / night.php / beaches.php / shopping.php / money.php)
						</p>
						<p>
							PHP was used to identify the page where the user is currently in.
						</p>
						<p>
							A sql table was created using phpMyAdmin to store name and comments on the blog page.
						</p>
						<p>
							The site has a favicon and appropriate titles on all pages.
