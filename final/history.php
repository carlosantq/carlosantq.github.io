								In the 17th Century, the Natal region was inhabited by indigenous people called "potiguares" (a term now used to refer to those who were born in Rio Grande do Norte).
							</p>

							<p>
								At the end of the 17th Century, after the arrival of the portuguese colonists, a construction of a fort was initiated to serve as combat against the attacks of the indigenous people and french enemies that wanted to rule Natal. The building received the name of Forte dos Reis Magos ("Fort of the Three Kings"), referring to the biblical story about the Three Kings who bring gifts to the baby Jesus on his birth. Today, the Forte dos Reis Magos is one of the most visited tourist spots in Natal.
